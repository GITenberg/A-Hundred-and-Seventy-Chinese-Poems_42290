<h2>PRELIMINARY NOTE</h2>


<p>In making this book I have tried to avoid poems
which have been translated before. A hundred and
forty of those I have chosen have not been translated
by any one else. The remaining thirty odd I have
included in many cases because the previous versions
were full of mistakes; in others, because the works in
which they appeared are no longer procurable. Moreover,
they are mostly in German, a language with
which my readers may not all be acquainted.</p>

<p>With some hesitation I have included literal versions
of six poems (three of the “Seventeen Old Poems,”
“Autumn Wind,” “Li Fu-jēn,” and “On the Death
of his Father”) already skilfully rhymed by Professor
Giles in “Chinese Poetry in English Verse.” They
were too typical to omit; and a comparison of the two
renderings may be of interest. Some of these translations
have appeared in the “Bulletin of the School of
Oriental Studies,” in the “New Statesman,” in the
“Little Review” (Chicago), and in “Poetry”
(Chicago).</p>

<h4>THE LIMITATIONS OF CHINESE LITERATURE</h4>

<p>Those who wish to assure themselves that they will
lose nothing by ignoring Chinese literature, often ask
the question: “Have the Chinese a Homer, an Aeschylus,
a Shakespeare or Tolstoy?” The answer must be that
China has no epic and no dramatic literature of importance.
The novel exists and has merits, but never became the instrument
of great writers.</p>

<p>Her philosophic literature knows no mean between the
traditionalism of Confucius and the nihilism of Chuang-tzŭ.
In mind, as in body, the Chinese were for the most part
torpid mainlanders. Their thoughts set out on no strange
quests and adventures, just as their ships discovered no
new continents. To most Europeans the momentary flash
of Athenian questioning will seem worth more than all the
centuries of Chinese assent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet we must recognize that for thousands of years the
Chinese maintained a level of rationality and tolerance that
the West might well envy. They had no Index, no Inquisition,
no Holy Wars. Superstition has indeed played its
part among them; but it has never, as in Europe, been
perpetually dominant. It follows from the limitations of
Chinese thought that the literature of the country should
excel in reflection rather than in speculation. That this is
particularly true of its poetry will be gauged from the
present volume. In the poems of Po Chü-i no close reasoning
or philosophic subtlety will be discovered; but a power
of candid reflection and self-analysis which has not been
rivalled in the West.</p>

<p>Turning from thought to emotion, the most conspicuous
feature of European poetry is its pre-occupation with love.
This is apparent not only in actual “love-poems,” but in
all poetry where the personality of the writer is in any way
obtruded. The poet tends to exhibit himself in a <i>romantic</i>
light; in fact, to recommend himself as a lover.</p>

<p>The Chinese poet has a tendency different but analogous.
He recommends himself not as a lover, but as a friend.
He poses as a person of infinite leisure (which is what we
should most like our friends to possess) and free from
worldly ambitions (which constitute the greatest bars to
friendship). He would have us think of him as a boon
companion, a great drinker of wine, who will not disgrace
a social gathering by quitting it sober.</p>

<p>To the European poet the relation between man and
woman is a thing of supreme importance and mystery. To
the Chinese, it is something commonplace, obvious&mdash;a need
of the body, not a satisfaction of the <i>emotions</i>. These he
reserves entirely for friendship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly we find that while our poets tend to lay stress
on physical courage and other qualities which normal women
admire, Po Chü-i is not ashamed to write such a poem as
“Alarm at entering the Gorges.” Our poets imagine themselves
very much as Art has portrayed them&mdash;bare-headed
and wild-eyed, with shirts unbuttoned at the neck as though
they feared that a seizure of emotion might at any minute
suffocate them. The Chinese poet introduces himself as a
timid recluse, “Reading the Book of Changes at the
Northern Window,” playing chess with a Taoist priest,
or practising caligraphy with an occasional visitor. If
“With a Portrait of the Author” had been the rule in the
Chinese book-market, it is in such occupations as these
that he would be shown; a neat and tranquil figure compared
with our lurid frontispieces.</p>

<p>It has been the habit of Europe to idealize love at the
expense of friendship and so to place too heavy a burden
on the relation of man and woman. The Chinese erred in
the opposite direction, regarding their wives and concubines
simply as instruments of procreation. For sympathy and
intellectual companionship they looked only to their friends.
But these friends were bound by no such tie as held women
to their masters; sooner or later they drifted away to
frontier campaigns, remote governorships, or country retirement.
It would not be an exaggeration to say that half
the poems in the Chinese language are poems of parting or
separation.</p>

<p>Readers of these translations may imagine that the culture
represented by Po Chü-i extended over the whole vast
confines of China. This would, I think, be an error. Culture
is essentially a metropolitan product. Chü-i was as
much <i>dépaysé</i> at a provincial town as Charles Lamb would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
have been at Botany Bay. But the system of Chinese
bureaucracy tended constantly to break up the literary
coteries which formed at the capitals, and to drive the
members out of the little corner of Shensi and Honan which
to them was “home.”</p>

<p>It was chiefly economic necessity which forced the poets
of China into the meshes of bureaucracy&mdash;backed by the
Confucian insistence on public service. To such as were
landowners there remained the alternative of agricultural
life, arduous and isolated.</p>

<p>The poet, then, usually passed through three stages of
existence. In the first we find him with his friends at the
capital, drinking, writing, and discussing: burdened by his
office probably about as much as Pepys was burdened by his
duties at the Admiralty. Next, having failed to curry favour
with the Court, he is exiled to some provincial post, perhaps
a thousand miles from anyone he cares to talk to. Finally,
having scraped together enough money to buy husbands for
his daughters, he retires to a small estate, collecting round
him the remnants of those with whom he had shared the
“feasts and frolics of old days.”</p>

<p>I have spoken hitherto only of poets. But the poetess
occupies a place of considerable importance in the first four
centuries of our era, though the classical period (T’ang
and Sung) produced no great woman writer. Her theme
varies little; she is almost always a “rejected wife,” cast
adrift by her lord or sent back to her home. Probably her
father would be unable to buy her another husband and
there was no place for unmarried women in the Chinese
social system. The moment, then, which produced such
poems was one of supreme tragedy in a woman’s life.</p>

<p>Love-poetry addressed by a man to a woman ceases after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the Han dynasty; but a conventional type of love-poem, in
which the poet (of either sex) speaks in the person of a
deserted wife or concubine, continues to be popular. The
theme appears to be almost an obsession with the T’ang
and Sung poets. In a vague way, such poems were felt to
be allegorical. Just as in the Confucian interpretation of
the love-poems in the Odes (see below) the woman typifies
the Minister, and the lover the Prince, so in those classical
poems the poet in a veiled way laments the thwarting of
his own public ambitions. Such tortuous expression of
emotion did not lead to good poetry.</p>

<p>The “figures of speech,” devices such as metaphor,
simile, and play on words, are used by the Chinese with
much more restraint than by us. “Metaphorical epithets”
are occasionally to be met with; waves, for example, might
perhaps be called “angry.” But in general the adjective
does not bear the heavy burden which our poets have laid
upon it. The Chinese would call the sky “blue,” “gray,”
or “cloudy,” according to circumstances; but never “triumphant”
or “terror-scourged.”</p>

<p>The long Homeric simile, introduced for its own sake or
to vary the monotony of narrative, is unknown to Chinese
poetry. Shorter similes are sometimes found, as when the
half-Chinese poet Altun compares the sky over the Mongolian
steppe with the “walls of a tent”; but nothing could
be found analogous to Mr. T.&nbsp;S. Eliot’s comparison of the
sky to a “patient etherized on a table.” Except in popular
poetry, puns are rare; but there are several characters which,
owing to the wideness of their import, are used in a way
almost equivalent to play on words.</p>

<p>Classical allusion, always the vice of Chinese poetry,
finally destroyed it altogether. In the later periods (from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the fourteenth century onwards) the use of elegant synonyms
also prevailed. I have before me a “gradus” of the
kind which the later poet used as an aid to composition.
The moon should be called the “Silver Dish,” “Frozen
Wheel,” or “Golden Ring.” Allusions may in this connection
be made to Yü Liang, who rode to heaven on the
crescent moon; to the hermit T’ang, who controlled the
genius of the New Moon, and kept him in his house as a
candle&mdash;or to any other of some thirty stories which are
given. The sun may be called “The Lantern-Dragon,” the
“Crow in Flight,” the “White Colt,” etc.</p>

<p>Such were the artificialities of later Chinese poetry.</p>


<h4>TECHNIQUE</h4>

<p>Certain elements are found, but in varying degree, in all
human speech. It is difficult to conceive of a language in
which rhyme, stress-accent, and tone-accent would not to
some extent occur. In all languages some vowel-sounds
are shorter than others and, in certain cases, two consecutive
words begin with the same sound. Other such
characteristics could be enumerated, but for the purposes
of poetry it is these elements which man has principally
exploited.</p>

<p>English poetry has used chiefly rhyme, stress, and alliteration.
It is doubtful if tone has ever played a part; a conscious
use has sporadically been made of quantity. Poetry
naturally utilizes the most marked and definite characteristics
of the language in which it is written. Such characteristics
are used consciously by the poet; but less
important elements also play their part, often only in a
negative way. Thus the Japanese actually avoid rhyme;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the Greeks did not exploit it, but seem to have tolerated it
when it occurred accidentally.</p>

<p>The expedients consciously used by the Chinese before
the sixth century were rhyme and length of line. A third
element, inherent in the language, was not exploited before
that date, but must always have been a factor in instinctive
considerations of euphony. This element was “tone.”</p>

<p>Chinese prosody distinguishes between two tones, a
“flat” and a “deflected.” In the first the syllable is enunciated
in a level manner: the voice neither rises nor sinks.
In the second, it (1) rises, (2) sinks, (3) is abruptly arrested.
These varieties make up the Four Tones of Classical
Chinese.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The “deflected” tones are distinctly more emphatic, and
so have a faint analogy to our stressed syllables. They are
also, in an even more remote way, analogous to the long
vowels of Latin prosody. A line ending with a “level” has
consequently to some extent the effect of a “feminine ending.”
Certain causes, which I need not specify here, led to
an increasing importance of “tone” in the Chinese language
from the fifth century onwards. It was natural that this
change should be reflected in Chinese prosody. A certain
Shēn Yo (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 441-513) first propounded the laws of tone-succession
in poetry. From that time till the eighth century
the <i>Lü-shih</i> or “strictly regulated poem” gradually
evolved. But poets continued (and continue till to-day),
side by side with their <i>lü-shih</i>, to write in the old metre
which disregards tone, calling such poems <i>Ku shih</i>, “old
poems.” Previous European statements about Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
prosody should be accepted with great caution. Writers
have attempted to define the <i>lü-shih</i> with far too great
precision.</p>

<p>The Chinese themselves are apt to forget that T’ang
poets seldom obeyed the laws designed in later school-books
as essential to classical poetry; or, if they notice that a
verse by Li Po does not conform, they stigmatize it as
“irregular and not to be imitated.”</p>

<p>The reader will infer that the distinction between “old
poems” and irregular <i>lü-shih</i> is often arbitrary. This is
certainly the case; I have found the same poem classified
differently in different native books. But it is possible to
enumerate certain characteristics which distinguish the two
kinds of verse. I will attempt to do so; but not till I have
discussed <i>rhyme</i>, the other main element in Chinese prosody.
It would be equally difficult to define accurately the difference
between the couplets of Pope and those of William
Morris. But it would not be impossible, by pointing out
certain qualities of each, to enable a reader to distinguish
between the two styles.</p>

<p><i>Rhyme.</i>&mdash;Most Chinese syllables ended with a vowel or
nasal sound. The Chinese rhyme was in reality a vowel
assonance. Words in different consonants rhymed so long
as the vowel-sound was exactly the same. Thus <i>ywet</i>,
“moon,” rhymed with <i>sek</i>, “beauty.” During the classical
period these consonant endings were gradually weakening,
and to-day, except in the south, they are wholly lost. It is
possible that from very early times final consonants were
lightly pronounced.</p>

<p>The rhymes used in <i>lü-shih</i> were standardized in the
eighth century, and some of them were no longer rhymes
to the ear in the Mandarin dialect. To be counted as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
rhyme, two words must have exactly the same vowel-sound.
Some of the distinctions then made are no longer audible
to-day; the sub-divisions therefore seem arbitrary. Absolute
homophony is also counted as rhyme, as in French. It is
as though we should make <i>made</i> rhyme with <i>maid</i>.</p>

<p>I will now attempt to distinguish between <i>Ku-shih</i> (old
style) and <i>Lü-shih</i> (new style).</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Ku-shih (Old Style).</i></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) According to the investigations of Chu Hua, an eighteenth
century critic, only thirty-four rhymes were used.
They were, indeed, assonances of the roughest kind.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) “Deflected” words are used for rhyming as freely as
“flat” words.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Tone-arrangement. The tones were disregarded.
(Lines can be found in pre-T’ang poems in which five deflected
tones occur in succession, an arrangement which
would have been painful to the ear of a T’ang writer and
would probably have been avoided by classical poets even
when using the old style.)</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Lü-shih (New Style).</i></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The rhymes used are the “106” of modern dictionaries
(not those of the Odes, as Giles states). Rhymes in the flat
tone are preferred. In a quatrain the lines which do not
rhyme must end on the opposite tone to that of the rhyme.
This law is absolute in <i>Lü-shih</i> and a tendency in this direction
is found even in <i>Ku-shih</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) There is a tendency to antithetical arrangement of
tones in the two lines of a couplet, especially in the last
part of the lines.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) A tendency for the tones to go in <i>pairs</i>, <i>e.g.</i> (A=flat,
B=deflected): AA BBA or ABB AA, rather than in <i>threes</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Three like tones only come together when divided by a
“cesura,” <i>e.g.</i>, the line BB / AAA would be avoided, but not
the line BBAA / ABB.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Verbal parallelism in the couplet, <i>e.g.</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">After long illness one first realizes that seeking medicines is a mistake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one’s decaying years one begins to repent that one’s study of books was deferred.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This device, used with some discretion in T’ang, becomes
an irritating trick in the hands of the Sung poets.</p><div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Not to be confused with the Four Tones of the Mandarin dialect,
in which the old names are used to describe quite different enunciations.</p></div>


<h4>THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF
CHINESE POETRY</h4>

<p><i>The Odes.</i>&mdash;From the songs current in his day Confucius
(551-479 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) chose about three hundred which he regarded
as suitable texts for his ethical and social teaching. Many
of them are eulogies of good rulers or criticisms of bad ones.
Out of the three hundred and five still extant only about
thirty are likely to interest the modern reader. Of these
half deal with war and half with love. Many translations
exist, the best being those of Legge in English and of
Couvreur in French. There is still room for an English
translation displaying more sensitivity to word-rhythm than
that of Legge. It should not, I think, include more than
fifty poems. But the Odes are essentially <i>lyric</i> poetry, and
their beauty lies in effects which cannot be reproduced in
English. For that reason I have excluded them from this
book; nor shall I discuss them further here, for full information
will be found in the works of Legge or Couvreur.</p>

<p><i>Elegies of the Land of Ch’u.</i>&mdash;We come next to Ch’ü
Yüan (third century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) whose famous poem “Li Sao,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
or “Falling into Trouble,” has also been translated by
Legge. It deals, under a love-allegory, with the relation
between the writer and his king. In this poem, sex and
politics are curiously interwoven, as we need not doubt they
were in Chü Yüan’s own mind. He affords a striking example
of the way in which abnormal mentality imposes
itself. We find his followers unsuccessfully attempting to
use the same imagery and rhapsodical verbiage, not realizing
that these were, as De Goncourt would say, the product
of their master’s <i>propre névrosité</i>.</p>

<p>“The Battle,” his one thoroughly intelligible poem, has
hitherto been only very imperfectly translated. A literal
version will be found on p. <a href="#Page_23">23</a>.</p>

<p>His nephew Sung Yü was no servile imitator. In addition
to “elegies” in the style of the Li Sao, he was the author of
many “Fu” or descriptive prose-poems, unrhymed but more
or less metrical.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>The Han Dynasty.</i>&mdash;Most of the Han poems in this book
were intended to be sung. Many of them are from the
official song-book of the dynasty and are known as Yo Fu
or Music Bureau poems, as distinct from <i>shih</i>, which were
recited. Ch’in Chia’s poem and his wife’s reply (p. <a href="#Page_54">54</a>) are
both <i>shih</i>; but all the rest might, I think, be counted as
songs.</p>

<p>The Han dynasty is rich in Fu (descriptions), but none
of them could be adequately translated. They are written
in an elaborate and florid style which recalls Apuleius or
Lyly.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>The Chin Dynasty.</i></p>

<p>(1) <i>Popular Songs</i> (Songs of Wu). The popular songs
referred to the Wu (Soochow) district and attributed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
fourth century may many of them have been current at a
much earlier date. They are slight in content and deal with
only one topic. They may, in fact, be called “Love-epigrams.”
They find a close parallel in the <i>coplas</i> of
Spain, <i>cf.</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<i><span class="i0">El candil se esta apagando,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">La alcuza no tiene aceite&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No te digo que te vayas, ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No te digo que te quedes.<br /></span></i>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The brazier is going out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lamp has no more oil&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I do not tell you to go, ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I do not tell you to stay.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A Han song, which I will translate quite literally, seems
to be the forerunner of the Wu songs.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On two sides of river, wedding made:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time comes; no boat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lusting heart loses hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not seeing what-it-desires.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(2) <i>The Taoists.</i>&mdash;Confucius inculcated the duty of public
service. Those to whom this duty was repulsive found support
in Taoism, a system which denied this obligation. The
third and fourth centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> witnessed a great reaction
against state service. It occurred to the intellectuals of
China that they would be happier growing vegetables in
their gardens than place-hunting at Nanking. They embraced
the theory that “by bringing himself into harmony
with Nature” man can escape every evil. Thus Tao
(Nature’s Way) corresponds to the Nirvana of Buddhism,
and the God of Christian mysticism.</p>

<p>They reduced to the simplest standard their houses,
apparel, and food; and discarded the load of book-learning
which Confucianism imposed on its adherents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>The greatest of these recluses was T’ao Ch’ien (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
365-427), twelve of whose poems will be found on p. <a href="#Page_71">71</a>,
<i>seq.</i> Something of his philosophy may be gathered from
the poem “Substance, Shadow, and Spirit” (p. <a href="#Page_73">73</a>), his
own views being voiced by the last speaker. He was not
an original thinker, but a great poet who reflects in an interesting
way the outlook of his time.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Liang and Minor Dynasties.</i>&mdash;This period is known as
that of the “Northern and Southern Courts.” The north
of China was in the hands of the Tungusie Tartars, who
founded the Northern Wei dynasty&mdash;a name particularly
familiar, since it is the habit of European collectors to
attribute to this dynasty any sculpture which they believe
to be earlier than T’ang. Little poetry was produced in the
conquered provinces; the Tartar emperors, though they
patronized Buddhist art, were incapable of promoting literature.
But at Nanking a series of emperors ruled, most of
whom distinguished themselves either in painting or poetry.
The Chinese have always (and rightly) despised the literature
of this period, which is “all flowers and moonlight.” A few
individual writers, such as Pao Chao, stand out as exceptions.
 <a id="Yuan-ti"></a>The Emperor Yüan-ti&mdash;who hacked his way to the
throne by murdering all other claimants, including his own
brother&mdash;is typical of the period both as a man and as a
poet. A specimen of his sentimental poetry will be found
on p. <a href="#Page_90">90</a>. When at last forced to abdicate, he heaped
together 200,000 books and pictures; and, setting fire
to them, exclaimed: “The culture of the Liang dynasty
perishes with me.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>T’ang.</i>&mdash;I have already described the technical developments
of poetry during this dynasty. Form was at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
time valued far above content. “Poetry,” says a critic,
“should draw its materials from the Han and Wei dynasties.”
With the exception of a few reformers, writers contented
themselves with clothing old themes in new forms. The
extent to which this is true can of course only be realized
by one thoroughly familiar with the earlier poetry.</p>

<p>In the main, T’ang confines itself to a narrow range of
stock subjects. The <i>mise-en-scène</i> is borrowed from earlier
times. If a battle-poem be written, it deals with the campaigns
of the Han dynasty, not with contemporary events.
The “deserted concubines” of conventional love-poetry
are those of the Han Court. Innumerable poems record
“Reflections on Visiting a Ruin,” or on “The Site of an
Old City,” etc. The details are ingeniously varied, but the
sentiments are in each case identical. Another feature is
the excessive use of historical allusions. This is usually
not apparent in rhymed translations, which evade such
references by the substitution of generalities. Poetry became
the medium not for the expression of a poet’s emotions,
but for the display of his classical attainments. The great
Li Po is no exception to this rule. Often where his translators
would make us suppose he is expressing a fancy of
his own, he is in reality skilfully utilizing some poem by
T’ao Ch’ien or Hsieh Ti’ao. It is for his versification that
he is admired, and with justice. He represents a reaction
against the formal prosody of his immediate predecessors.
It was in the irregular song-metres of his <i>ku-shih</i> that he
excelled. In such poems as the “Ssech’uan Road,” with
its wild profusion of long and short lines, its cataract of
exotic verbiage, he aimed at something nearer akin to
music than to poetry. Tu Fu, his contemporary, occasionally
abandoned the cult of “abstract form.” Both poets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
lived through the most tragic period of Chinese history. In
755 the Emperor’s Turkic favourite, An Lu-shan, revolted
against his master. A civil war followed, in which China
lost thirty million men. The dynasty was permanently enfeebled
and the Empire greatly curtailed by foreign incursions.
So ended the “Golden Age” of Ming Huang. Tu
Fu, stirred by the horror of massacres and conscriptions,
wrote a series of poems in the old style, which Po Chü-i
singles out for praise. One of them, “The Press-gang,” is
familiar in Giles’s translation. Li Po, meanwhile, was
writing complimentary poems on the Emperor’s “Tour in
the West”&mdash;a journey which was in reality a precipitate
flight from his enemies.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Sung.</i>&mdash;In regard to content the Sung poets show even
less originality than their predecessors. Their whole energy
was devoted towards inventing formal restrictions. The
“tz’ŭ” developed, a species of song in lines of irregular
length, written in strophes, each of which must conform to
a strict pattern of tones and rhymes. The content of the
“tz’ŭ” is generally wholly conventional. Very few have
been translated; and it is obvious that they are unsuitable
for translation, since their whole merit lies in metrical dexterity.
Examples by the poetess Li I-an will be found in
the second edition of Judith Gautier’s “Livre de Jade.”
The poetry of Su Tung-p’o, the foremost writer of the
period, is in its matter almost wholly a patchwork of earlier
poems. It is for the musical qualities of his verse that he
is valued by his countrymen. He hardly wrote a poem
which does not contain a phrase (sometimes a whole line)
borrowed from Po Chü-i, for whom in his critical writings
he expresses boundless admiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>A word must be said of the Fu (descriptive prose-poems)
of this time. They resemble the <i>vers libres</i> of modern
France, using rhyme occasionally (like Georges Duhamel)
as a means of “sonner, rouler, quand il faut faire donner
les cuivres et la batterie.” Of this nature is the magnificent
“Autumn Dirge” (Giles, “Chinese Lit.,” p. 215) by
Ou-yang Hsiu, whose lyric poetry is of small interest.
The subsequent periods need not much concern us. In the
eighteenth century the garrulous Yüan Mei wrote his
“Anecdotes of Poetry-making”&mdash;a book which, while one
of the most charming in the language, probably contains
more bad poetry (chiefly that of his friends) than any in the
world. His own poems are modelled on Po Chü-i and Su
Tung-p’o.</p>

<p>This introduction is intended for the general reader. I
have therefore stated my views simply and categorically,
and without entering into controversies which are of interest
only to a few specialists.</p>

<p>As an account of the development of Chinese poetry these
notes are necessarily incomplete, but it is hoped that they
answer some of those questions which a reader would be
most likely to ask.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>




<h3>THE METHOD OF TRANSLATION</h3>


<p>It is commonly asserted that poetry, when literally translated,
ceases to be poetry. This is often true, and I
have for that reason not attempted to translate many poems
which in the original have pleased me quite as much as
those I have selected. But I present the ones I have chosen
in the belief that they still retain the essential characteristics
of poetry.</p>

<p>I have aimed at literal translation, not paraphrase. It
may be perfectly legitimate for a poet to borrow foreign
themes or material, but this should not be called translation.</p>

<p>Above all, considering imagery to be the soul of poetry,
I have avoided either adding images of my own or suppressing
those of the original.</p>

<p>Any literal translation of Chinese poetry is bound to be
to some extent rhythmical, for the rhythm of the original
obtrudes itself. Translating literally, without thinking
about the metre of the version, one finds that about two
lines out of three have a very definite swing similar to that
of the Chinese lines. The remaining lines are just too short
or too long, a circumstance very irritating to the reader,
whose ear expects the rhythm to continue. I have therefore
tried to produce regular rhythmic effects similar to those of
the original. Each character in the Chinese is represented
by a stress in the English; but between the stresses unstressed
syllables are of course interposed. In a few instances
where the English insisted on being shorter than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the Chinese, I have preferred to vary the metre of my
version, rather than pad out the line with unnecessary
verbiage.</p>

<p>I have not used rhyme because it is impossible to produce
in English rhyme-effects at all similar to those of the original,
where the same rhyme sometimes runs through a whole
poem. Also, because the restrictions of rhyme necessarily
injure either the vigour of one’s language or the literalness
of one’s version. I do not, at any rate, know of any example
to the contrary. What is generally known as “blank
verse” is the worst medium for translating Chinese poetry,
because the essence of blank verse is that it varies the position
of its pauses, whereas in Chinese the stop always comes
at the end of the couplet.</p>

<h3>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES</h3>


<p>1. H.&nbsp;A. Giles, “Chinese Poetry in English Verse.” 1896. 212 pp.
Combines rhyme and literalness with wonderful dexterity.</p>

<p>2. Hervey St. Denys, “Poésies des Thang.” 1862. 301 pp. The
choice of poems would have been very different if the author had
selected from the whole range of T’ang poetry, instead of contenting
himself, except in the case of Li Po and Tu Fu, with making extracts
from two late anthologies. This book, the work of a great scholar, is
reliable&mdash;except in its information about Chinese prosody.</p>

<p>3. Judith Gautier, “Le Livre de Jade.” 1867 and 1908. It has been
difficult to compare these renderings with the original, for proper
names are throughout distorted or interchanged. For example, part
of a poem by Po Chü-i <i>about</i> Yang T’ai-chēn is here given as a complete
poem and ascribed to “Yan-Ta-Tchen” as author. The poet
Han Yü figures as Heu-Yu; T’ao Han as Sao Nan, etc. Such mistakes
are evidently due to faulty decipherment of someone else’s writing.
Nevertheless, the book is far more readable than that of St. Denys,
and shows a wider acquaintance with Chinese poetry on the part of
whoever chose the poems. Most of the credit for this selection must
certainly be given to Ting Tun-ling, the <i>literatus</i> whom Théophile
Gautier befriended. But the credit for the beauty of these often
erroneous renderings must go to Mademoiselle Gautier herself.</p>

<p>5. Zottoli, “Cursus Litteraturae Sinicae.” 1886. Chinese text with
Latin translation. Vol. V deals with poetry. None of the poems is
earlier than T’ang. The Latin is seldom intelligible without reference
to the Chinese. Translators have obviously used Zottoli as a text.
Out of eighteen Sung poems in Giles’s book, sixteen will be found in
Zottoli.</p>

<h4 class="title">THE MAN-WIND AND THE WOMAN-WIND</h4>

<div class="comment">

<p>A “fu,” or prose-poem, by Sung Yü (fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), nephew
of Ch’ü Yüan.</p></div>

<p>Hsiang, king of Ch’u, was feasting in the Orchid-tower
Palace, with Sung Yü and Ching Ch’ai to wait upon him.
A gust of wind blew in and the king bared his breast to
meet it, saying: “How pleasant a thing is this wind which
I share with the common people.” Sung Yü answered:
“This is the Great King’s wind. The common people
cannot share it.” The king said: “Wind is a spirit of
Heaven and Earth. It comes wide spread and does not
choose between noble and base or between high and low.
How can you say ‘This is the king’s wind’?” Sung answered:
“I have heard it taught that in the crooked lemon-tree
birds make their nests and to empty spaces winds fly.
But the wind-spirit that comes to different things is not the
same.” The king said: “Where is the wind born?” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Sung answered: “The wind is born in the ground. It rises
in the extremities of the green p’ing-flower. It pours into
the river-valleys and rages at the mouth of the pass. It
follows the rolling flanks of Mount T’ai and dances beneath
the pine-trees and cypresses. In gusty bouts it whirls. It
rushes in fiery anger. It rumbles low with a noise like
thunder, tearing down rocks and trees, smiting forests and
grasses.</p>

<p>“But at last abating, it spreads abroad, seeks empty
places and crosses the threshold of rooms. And so growing
gentler and clearer, it changes and is dispersed and dies.</p>

<p>“It is this cool clear Man-Wind that, freeing itself, falls
and rises till it climbs the high walls of the Castle and enters
the gardens of the Inner Palace. It bends the flowers and
leaves with its breath. It wanders among the osmanthus
and pepper-trees. It lingers over the fretted face of the
pond, to steal the soul of the hibiscus. It touches the willow
leaves and scatters the fragrant herbs. Then it pauses in
the courtyard and turning to the North goes up to the Jade
Hall, shakes the hanging curtains and lightly passes into
the inner room.</p>

<p>“And so it becomes the Great King’s wind.</p>

<p>“Now such a wind is fresh and sweet to breathe and its
gentle murmuring cures the diseases of men, blows away
the stupor of wine, sharpens sight and hearing and refreshes
the body. This is what is called the Great King’s wind.”</p>

<p>The king said: “You have well described it. Now tell
me of the common people’s wind.” Sung said: “The common
people’s wind rises from narrow lanes and streets,
carrying clouds of dust. Rushing to empty spaces it attacks
the gateway, scatters the dust-heap, sends the cinders flying,
pokes among foul and rotting things, till at last it enters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the tiled windows and reaches the rooms of the cottage.
Now this wind is heavy and turgid, oppressing man’s heart.
It brings fever to his body, ulcers to his lips and dimness
to his eyes. It shakes him with coughing; it kills him
before his time.</p>

<p>“Such is the Woman-wind of the common people.”</p>


<p class="p2">The following is a sample of Sung Yü’s prose:</p>

<h4 class="title">MASTER TĒNG-T’U</h4>

<div class="comment">

<p>By Sung Yü (third century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>)</p></div>

<p>One day when the Chamberlain, master Tēng-t’u, was in
attendance at the Palace he warned the King against Sung
Yü, saying: “Yü is a man of handsome features and calm
bearing and his tongue is prompt with subtle sentences.
Moreover, his character is licentious. I would submit that
your Majesty is ill-advised in allowing him to follow you
into the Queen’s apartments.” The King repeated Tēng-t’u’s
words to Sung Yü. Yü replied: “My beauty of face
and calmness of bearing were given me by Heaven.
Subtlety of speech I learnt from my teachers. As for my
character, I deny that it is licentious.” The King said:
“Can you substantiate your statement that you are not
licentious? If you cannot, you must leave the Court.” Sung
Yü said: “Of all the women in the world, the most beautiful
are the women of the land of Ch’u. And in all the land of
Ch’u there are none like the women of my own village.
And in my village there are none that can be compared
with the girl next door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“The girl next door would be too tall if an inch were added
to her height, and too short if an inch were taken away.
Another grain of powder would make her too pale; another
touch of rouge would make her too red. Her eyebrows are
like the plumage of the kingfisher, her flesh is like snow.
Her waist is like a roll of new silk, her teeth are like little
shells. A single one of her smiles would perturb the whole city
of Yang and derange the suburb of Hsia-ts’ai.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> For three
years this lady has been climbing the garden wall and
peeping at me, yet I have never succumbed.</p>


<p>“How different is the behaviour of master Tēng-t’u! His
wife has a wooly head and misshapen ears; projecting teeth
irregularly set; a crook in her back and a halt in her gait.
Moreover, she has running sores in front and behind.</p>

<p>“Yet Tēng-t’u fell in love with her and caused her to bear
him five children.</p>

<p>“I would have your Majesty consider which of us is the
debauchee.”</p>

<p>Sung Yü was not dismissed from court.</p>

<h4 class="title">SEVENTEEN OLD POEMS</h4>

<div class="comment">

<p>The following seventeen poems are from a series known as the
Nineteen Pieces of Old Poetry. Some have been attributed to Mei
Shēng (first century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), and one to Fu I (first century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>). They
are manifestly not all by the same hand nor of the same date. Internal
evidence shows that No. 3 at least was written after the date of Mei
Shēng’s death. These poems had an enormous influence on all subsequent
poetry, and many of the habitual <i>clichés</i> of Chinese verse are
taken from them. I have omitted two because of their marked inferiority.</p></div>

<h4 class="title">SONG OF SNOW-WHITE HEADS</h4>

<div class="comment">

<p>Ssŭ-ma Hsiang-ju was a young poet who had lost his position at
court owing to ill-health. One day Cho Wēn-chün, a rich man’s
daughter, heard him singing at a feast given by her father. She
eloped with him that night, and they set up a wine-shop together.
After a time Hsiang-ju became famous as a poet, but his character
was marred by love of money. He sold love-poems, which the ladies
of the palace sent to the emperor in order to win his favour. Finally,
he gave presents to the “ladies of Mo-ling,” hoping to secure a concubine.
It was this step that induced his mistress, Cho Wēn-chün, to
write the following poem.</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When I was young I played with a soft brush<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In prose I made Chia I my standard:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In verse I imitated Ssŭ-ma Hsiang-ju.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I felt as though Tung Wu were already annihilated.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scholar’s knife cuts best at its first use<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my dreams hurried on to the completion of my plan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wanted at a stroke to clear the Yang-tze and Hsiang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at a glance to quell the Tibetans and Hu.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When my task was done, I should not accept a barony,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I put on my dress of apricot-yellow silk<br /></span>

<p>Altun (486-566 A.D.) was a Tartar employed by the Chinese in drilling
their troops “after the manner of the Huns.” He could not read or
write. The “Yo Fu Kuang T’i” says: Kao Huan attacked Pi, king
of Chou, but lost nearly half his men. Kao Huan fell ill of sadness and
Pi, to taunt him, sent out a proclamation, which said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>When this reached Kao Huan’s ears, he sat up in bed and tried to
comfort his officers. All the nobles were summoned to his room, and
Altun was asked to sing them a song about Tchirek, his native land.
He sang:</p></div>

<p>“Altun” means “gold” in Tartar. No one could teach him to write
the Chinese character for <i>gold</i>, till at last some one said: “Draw the
roof of your house and then put a few strokes underneath.” He thus
learnt, in a rough fashion, to write his own name.</p></div>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>


<p>Po Chü-i was born at T’ai-yüan in Shansi. Most of
his childhood was spent at Jung-yang in Honan. His
father was a second-class Assistant Department Magistrate.
He tells us that his family was poor and often in
difficulties.</p>

<p>He seems to have settled permanently at Ch’ang-an in
801. This town, lying near the north-west frontier, was
the political capital of the Empire. In its situation it somewhat
resembled Madrid. Lo-yang, the Eastern city, owing
to its milder climate and more accessible position, became,
like Seville in Spain, a kind of <i>social</i> capital.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards he met Yüan Chēn, then aged twenty-two,
who was destined to play so important a part in his
life. Five years later, during a temporary absence from
the city, he addressed to Yüan the following poem:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Since I left my home to seek official state<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seven years I have lived in Ch’ang-an.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What have I gained? Only you, Yüan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So hard it is to bind friendships fast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have roamed on horseback under the flowering trees;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have walked in the snow and warmed our hearts with wine.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">We have met and parted at the Western Gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And neither of us bothered to put on Cap or Belt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We did not go up together for Examination;<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>
<p>Of Yüan’s appearance at this time we may guess something
from a picture which still survives in copy; it shows
him, a youthful and elegant figure, visiting his cousin
Ts’ui Ying-ying, who was a lady-in-waiting at Court.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> At
this period of his life Po made friends with difficulty, not
being, as he tells us, “a master of such accomplishments
as caligraphy, painting, chess or gambling, which tend
to bring men together in pleasurable intercourse.” Two
older men, T’ang Ch’ü and Tēng Fang, liked his poetry
and showed him much kindness; another, the politician
K’ung T’an, won his admiration on public grounds. But
all three died soon after he got to know them. Later he
made three friends with whom he maintained a lifelong
intimacy: the poet Liu Yū-hsi (called Mēng-tē), and the
two officials Li Chien and Ts’ui Hsuan-liang. In 805 Yüan
Chēn was banished for provocative behaviour towards
a high official. The T’ang History relates the episode as
follows: “Yüan was staying the night at the Fu-shui Inn;
just as he was preparing to go to sleep in the Main Hall,
the court-official Li Shih-yüan also arrived. Yüan Chēn
should have offered to withdraw from the Hall. He did
not do so and a scuffle ensued. Yüan, locked out of the
building, took off his shoes and stole round to the back,
hoping to find another way in. Liu followed with a whip
and struck him across the face.”</p>


<p>The separation was a heavy blow to Po Chü-i. In a
poem called “Climbing Alone to the Lo-yu Gardens”
he says:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I look down on the Twelve City Streets:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red dust flanked by green trees!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coaches and horsemen alone fill my eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I do not see whom my heart longs to see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">K’ung T’an has died at Lo-yang;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yüan Chēn is banished to Ching-mēn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all that walk on the North-South Road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is not one that I care for more than the rest!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In 804 on the death of his father, and again in 811 on
the death of his mother, he spent periods of retirement on
the Wei river near Ch’ang-an. It was during the second of
these periods that he wrote the long poem (260 lines) called
“Visiting the Wu-chēn Temple.” Soon after his return to
Ch’ang-an, which took place in the winter of 814, he fell
into official disfavour. In two long memorials entitled
“On Stopping the War,” he had criticized the handling of
a campaign against an unimportant tribe of Tartars, which
he considered had been unduly prolonged. In a series of
poems he had satirized the rapacity of minor officials and
called attention to the intolerable sufferings of the masses.</p>

<p>His enemies soon found an opportunity of silencing him.
In 814 the Prime Minister, Wu Yüan-hēng, was assassinated
in broad daylight by an agent of the revolutionary
leader Wu Yüan-chi. Po, in a memorial to the Throne,
pointed out the urgency of remedying the prevailing discontent.
He held at this time the post of assistant secretary
to the Princes’ tutor. He should not have criticized
the Prime Minister (for being murdered!) until the official
Censors had spoken, for he held a Palace appointment
which did not carry with it the right of censorship.</p>

<p>His opponents also raked up another charge. His
mother had met her death by falling into a well while
looking at flowers. Chü-i had written two poems entitled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
“In Praise of Flowers” and “The New Well.” It was
claimed that by choosing such subjects he had infringed
the laws of Filial Piety.</p>

<p>He was banished to Kiukiang (then called Hsün-yang)
with the rank of Sub-Prefect. After three years he was
given the Governorship of Chung-chou, a remote place in
Ssech’uan. On the way up the Yangtze he met Yüan Chēn
after three years of separation. They spent a few days together
at I-ch’ang, exploring the rock-caves of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Chung-chou is noted for its “many flowers and exotic
trees,” which were a constant delight to its new Governor.
In the winter of 819 he was recalled to the capital and
became a second-class Assistant Secretary. About this
time Yüan Chēn also returned to the city.</p>

<p>In 821 the Emperor Mou Tsung came to the throne.
His arbitrary mis-government soon caused a fresh rising
in the north-west. Chü-i remonstrated in a series of
memorials and was again removed from the capital&mdash;this
time to be Governor of the important town of Hangchow.
Yüan now held a judicial post at Ningpo and the two were
occasionally able to meet.</p>

<p>In 824 his Governorship expired and he lived (with the
nominal rank of Imperial Tutor) at the village of Li-tao-li,
near Lo-yang. It was here that he took into his household
two girls, Fan-su and Man-tzŭ, whose singing and dancing
enlivened his retreat. He also brought with him from
Hangchow a famous “Indian rock,” and two cranes of
the celebrated “Hua-t’ing” breed. Other amenities of his
life at this time were a recipe for making sweet wine,
the gift of Ch’ēn Hao-hsien; a harp-melody taught him
by Ts’ui Hsuan-liang; and a song called “Autumn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Thoughts,” brought by the concubine of a visitor from
Ssech’uan.</p>

<p>In 825 he became Governor of Soochow. Here at the
age of fifty-three he enjoyed a kind of second youth, much
more sociable than that of thirty years before; we find him
endlessly picnicking and feasting. But after two years
illness obliged him to retire.</p>

<p>He next held various posts at the capital, but again fell
ill, and in 829 settled at Lo-yang as Governor of the
Province of Honan. Here his first son, A-ts’ui, was born,
but died in the following year.</p>

<p>In 831 Yüan Chēn also died.</p>

<p>Henceforth, though for thirteen years he continued to
hold nominal posts, he lived a life of retirement. In 832 he
repaired an unoccupied part of the Hsiang-shan monastery
at Lung-mēn,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> a few miles south of Lo-yang, and lived
there, calling himself the Hermit of Hsiang-shan. Once
he invited to dinner eight other elderly and retired
officials; the occasion was recorded in a picture entitled
“The Nine Old Men at Hsiang-shan.” There is no evidence
that his association with them was otherwise than
transient, though legend (see “Mémoires Concernant les
Chinois” and Giles, Biographical Dictionary) has invested
the incident with an undue importance. He amused himself
at this time by writing a description of his daily life
which would be more interesting if it were not so closely
modelled on a famous memoir by T’ao Ch’ien. In the winter
of 839 he was attacked by paralysis and lost the use of
his left leg. After many months in bed he was again able
to visit his garden, carried by Ju-man, a favourite monk.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>
<p>In 842 Liu Yü-hsi, the last survivor of the four friends,
and a constant visitor at the monastery, “went to wander
with Yüan Chēn in Hades.” The monk Ju-man also died.</p>

<p>The remaining years of Po’s life were spent in collecting
and arranging his Complete Works. Copies were presented
to the principal monasteries (the “Public Libraries” of the
period) in the towns with which he had been connected.
He died in 846, leaving instructions that his funeral should
be without pomp and that he should be buried not in the
family tomb at Hsia-kuei, but by Ju-man’s side in the
Hsiang-shan Monastery. He desired that a posthumous
title should not be awarded.</p>

<p>The most striking characteristic of Po Chü-i’s poetry is
its verbal simplicity. There is a story that he was in the
habit of reading his poems to an old peasant woman and
altering any expression which she could not understand.
The poems of his contemporaries were mere elegant diversions
which enabled the scholar to display his erudition,
or the literary juggler his dexterity. Po expounded his
theory of poetry in a letter to Yüan Chēn. Like Confucius,
he regarded art solely as a method of conveying instruction.
He is not the only great artist who has advanced
this untenable theory. He accordingly valued his didactic
poems far above his other work; but it is obvious that
much of his best poetry conveys no moral whatever. He
admits, indeed, that among his “miscellaneous stanzas”
many were inspired by some momentary sensation or passing
event. “A single laugh or a single sigh were rapidly
translated into verse.”</p>

<p>The didactic poems or “satires” belong to the period
before his first banishment. “When the tyrants and favourites
heard my Songs of Ch’in, they looked at one another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and changed countenance,” he boasts. Satire, in the
European sense, implies <i>wit</i>; but Po’s satires are as lacking
in true wit as they are unquestionably full of true
poetry. We must regard them simply as moral tales in
verse.</p>

<p>In the conventional lyric poetry of his predecessors he
finds little to admire. Among the earlier poems of the
T’ang dynasty he selects for praise the series by Ch’ēn
Tzŭ-ang, which includes “Business Men.” In Li Po and
Tu Fu he finds a deficiency of “fēng” and “ya.” The two
terms are borrowed from the Preface to the Odes. “Fēng”
means “criticism of one’s rulers”; “ya,” “moral guidance
to the masses.”</p>

<p>“The skill,” he says in the same letter, “which Tu Fu
shows in threading on to his <i>lü-shih</i> a ramification of
allusions ancient and modern could not be surpassed; in
this he is even superior to Li Po. But, if we take the
‘Press-gang’ and verses like that stanza:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At the palace doors the smell of meat and wine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the road the bones of one who was frozen to death.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>what a small part of his whole work it represents!”</p>

<p>Content, in short, he valued far above form: and it was
part of his theory, though certainly not of his practice,
that this content ought to be definitely moral. He aimed
at raising poetry from the triviality into which it had sunk
and restoring it to its proper intellectual level. It is an
irony that he should be chiefly known to posterity, in
China, Japan, and the West, as the author of the “Everlasting
Wrong.”<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> He set little store by the poem himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and, though a certain political moral might be read into it,
its appeal is clearly romantic.</p>

<p>His other poem of sentiment, the “Lute Girl,”<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> accords
even less with his stated principles. With these he ranks
his <i>Lü-shih</i>; and it should here be noted that all the satires
and long poems are in the old style of versification, while
his lighter poems are in the strict, modern form. With his
satires he classes his “reflective” poems, such as “Singing
in the Mountains,” “On being removed from Hsün-yang,”
“Pruning Trees,” etc. These are all in the old
style.</p>

<p>No poet in the world can ever have enjoyed greater contemporary
popularity than Po. His poems were “on the
mouths of kings, princes, concubines, ladies, plough-boys,
and grooms.” They were inscribed “on the walls of village-schools,
temples, and ships-cabins.” “A certain
Captain Kao Hsia-yü was courting a dancing-girl. ‘You
must not think I am an ordinary dancing-girl,’ she said to
him, ‘I can recite Master Po’s “Everlasting Wrong.”’
And she put up her price.”</p>

<p>But this popularity was confined to the long, romantic
poems and the <i>Lü-shih</i>. “The world,” writes Po to Yüan
Chēn, “values highest just those of my poems which I
most despise. Of contemporaries you alone have understood
my satires and reflective poems. A hundred, a
thousand years hence perhaps some one will come who
will understand them as you have done.”</p>

<p>The popularity of his lighter poems lasted till the Ming
dynasty, when a wave of pedantry swept over China. At
that period his poetry was considered vulgar, because it
was not erudite; and prosaic, because it was not rhetorical.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
<p>Although they valued form far above content, not even the
Ming critics can accuse him of slovenly writing. His versification
is admitted by them to be “correct.”</p>

<p>Caring, indeed, more for matter than for manner, he
used with facility and precision the technical instruments
which were at his disposal. Many of the later anthologies
omit his name altogether, but he has always had isolated
admirers. Yüan Mei imitates him constantly, and Chao I
(died 1814) writes: “Those who accuse him of being
vulgar and prosaic know nothing of poetry.”</p>

<p>Even during his lifetime his reputation had reached
Japan, and great writers like Michizane were not ashamed
to borrow from him. He is still held in high repute there,
is the subject of a Nō Play and has even become a kind of
Shintō deity. It is significant that the only copy of his works
in the British Museum is a seventeenth-century Japanese
edition.</p>

<p>It is usual to close a biographical notice with an attempt
to describe the “character” of one’s subject. But I hold
myself absolved from such a task; for the sixty poems
which follow will enable the reader to perform it for himself.</p>

<p>This poem is an attack on the Emperor Hsien-tsung, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 806-820,
who “was devoted to magic.” A Taoist wizard told him that herbs
of longevity grew near the city of T’ai-chou. The Emperor at once
appointed him prefect of the place, “pour lui permettre d’herboriser
plus à son aise” (Wieger, Textes III, 1723). When the censors protested,
the Emperor replied: “The ruin of a single district would be a
small price to pay, if it could procure longevity for the Lord of Men.”</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was once a man who dreamt he went to Heaven:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His dream-body soared aloft through space.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rode on the back of a white-plumed crane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And was led on his flight by two crimson banners.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whirring of wings and flapping of coat tails!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jade bells suddenly all a-tinkle!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half way to Heaven, he looked down beneath him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down on the dark turmoil of the World.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gradually he lost the place of his native town;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mountains and water&mdash;nothing else distinct.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Eastern Ocean&mdash;a single strip of white:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Hills of China,&mdash;five specks of green.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gliding past him a host of fairies swept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In long procession to the Palace of the Jade City.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How should he guess that the children of Tzŭ-mēn<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bow to the throne like courtiers of earthly kings?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They take him to the presence of the Mighty Jade Emperor:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bows his head and proffers loyal homage.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The Emperor says: “We see you have fairy talents:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be of good heart and do not slight yourself.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We shall send to fetch you in fifteen years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give you a place in the Courtyard of Immortality.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twice bowing, he acknowledged the gracious words:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then woke from sleep, full of wonder and joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hid his secret and dared not tell it abroad:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But vowed a vow he would live in a cave of rock.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From love and affection he severed kith and kin:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his eating and drinking he omitted savoury and spice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His morning meal was a dish of coral-dust:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At night he sipped an essence of dewy mists.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the empty mountains he lived for thirty years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Daily watching for the Heavenly Coach to come.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The time of appointment was already long past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of wings and coach-bells&mdash;still no sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His teeth and hair daily withered and decayed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ears and eyes gradually lost their keenness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One morning he suffered the Common Change<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his body was one with the dust and dirt of the hill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gods and fairies! If indeed such things there be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their ways are beyond the striving of mortal men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you have not on your skull the Golden Bump’s protrusion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If your name is absent from the rolls of the Red Terrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain you learn the “Method of Avoiding Food”:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For naught you study the “Book of Alchemic Lore.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though you sweat and toil, what shall your trouble bring?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You will only shorten the five-score years of your span.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad, alas, the man who dreamt of Fairies!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a single dream spoiled his whole life.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who carried them off through the Five Clouds, soaring away to Heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their halls and houses, that they could not take with them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were turned into Temples planted in the Dust of the World.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the tiring-rooms and dancers’ towers all is silent and still;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only the willows like dancers’ arms, and the pond like a mirror.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the flowers are falling at yellow twilight, when things are sad and hushed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One does not hear songs and flutes, but only chimes and bells.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Imperial Patent on the Temple doors is written in letters of gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For nuns’ quarters and monks’ cells ample space is allowed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For green moss and bright moonlight&mdash;plenty of room provided;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a hovel opposite is a sick man who has hardly room to lie down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I remember once when at P’ing-yang they were building a great man’s house<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His face, stained with dust and ashes, has turned to the colour of smoke.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Oxen,&mdash;weary; man,&mdash;hungry: the sun, already high;<br /></span>

<span class="small">(<span class="smcap">A Satire on Militarism</span>)</span></h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At Hsin-fēng an old man&mdash;four-score and eight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hair on his head and the hair of his eyebrows&mdash;white as the new snow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaning on the shoulders of his great-grandchildren, he walks in front of the Inn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his left arm he leans on their shoulders; his right arm is broken.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I asked the old man how many years had passed since he broke his arm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I also asked the cause of the injury, how and why it happened?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old man said he was born and reared in the District of Hsin-fēng;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the time of his birth&mdash;a wise reign; no wars or discords.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Often I listened in the Pear-Tree Garden to the sound of flute and song;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Naught I knew of banner and lance; nothing of arrow or bow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came the wars of T’ien-pao<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and the great levy of men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of three men in each house,&mdash;one man was taken.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those to whom the lot fell, where were they taken to?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Five months’ journey, a thousand miles&mdash;away to Yün-nan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We heard it said that in Yün-nan there flows the Lu River;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the flowers fall from the pepper-trees, poisonous vapours rise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the great army waded across, the water seethed like a cauldron;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When barely ten had entered the water, two or three were dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the north of my village, to the south of my village the sound of weeping and wailing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Children parting from fathers and mothers; husbands parting from wives.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Everyone says that in expeditions against the Min tribes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a million men who are sent out, not one returns.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">I, that am old, was then twenty-four;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My name and fore-name were written down in the rolls of the Board of War.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the depth of the night not daring to let any one know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I secretly took a huge stone and dashed it against my arm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For drawing the bow and waving the banner now wholly unfit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew henceforward I should not be sent to fight in Yün-nan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bones broken and sinews wounded could not fail to hurt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was ready enough to bear pain, if only I got back home.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
<span class="i0">My arm&mdash;broken ever since; it was sixty years ago.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One limb, although destroyed,&mdash;whole body safe!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But even now on winter nights when the wind and rain blow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From evening on till day’s dawn I cannot sleep for pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i16">Not sleeping for pain<br /></span>
<span class="i16">Is a small thing to bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Compared with the joy of being alive when all the rest are dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For otherwise, years ago, at the ford of Lu River<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My body would have died and my soul hovered by the bones that no one gathered.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A ghost, I’d have wandered in Yün-nan, always looking for home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the graves of ten thousand soldiers, mournfully hovering.”<br /></span>
<span class="i16">So the old man spoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">And I bid you listen to his words<br /></span>
<span class="i16">Have you not heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the Prime Minister of K’ai-yüan,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Sung K’ai-fu,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did not reward frontier exploits, lest a spirit of aggression should prevail?<br /></span>
<span class="i16">And have you not heard<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Desiring to win imperial favour, started a frontier war?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But long before he could win the war, people had lost their temper;<br /></span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
